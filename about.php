                        This is the story of a time before Lightning Flash and the Black Swordsman were known by those
                        names…
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Asuna Yuuki was a girl in the ninth grade who'd never had anything to do with online games when
                        she accidentally put on the NerveGear that fateful day.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The game master speaks.
                        This may be a game, but it's not something you play.
                        “Game Over” means you die in the real world.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Hearing this, the players are sent into a state of confusion, and pandemonium reigns in the
                        game. One of these players is Asuna. Despite not even knowing the rules of this new world, she
                        sets out on her journey to the floating steel castle of Aincrad, its apex not yet visible.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As she continues to live on in this world where death is always a step away, Asuna has a fateful
                        encounter followed by a parting…
